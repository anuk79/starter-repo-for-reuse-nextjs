# [starter-repo-for-reuse-nextjs](https://starter-repo-for-reuse-nextjs.vercel.app/)
Created a started repo for reuse. It contains a barebone structure which has been built with nextjs.

## Inspiration credit:
The layout is largely inspired by [Brian Holt's](https://github.com/btholt) course websites([Check example here](https://btholt.github.io/intro-to-web-dev-v2/)) for frontends masters
